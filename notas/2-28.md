* Indicator random values = binary random variable (1 or 0)

* $\mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}(X))^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2$

* Sometimes we just need an upper bound
    * Markov Inequality
    * Chebyshev Inequality

* Exponential dist is analog to geometric distribution
    * How long do I have to wait instead of how many trials do I have to do
