* planar graphâ€”we have 4 cardinal directions and each are connected by an undirected edge
* DFS on average has fastern runtime than BFS
* Single-source shortest path
* BFS is caching more data than DFS
* BFS doesn't care if the graph is weighted

# Dijkstra
* Dijkstra's is the exact same as BFS for a weighted graph
* Completed vs. unexplored vs. pending (Dijkstra's algorithm)
    * The pending nodes have A path but not necessarily all routes have been found
* Data structures needs: heap/priority queue (to store the *smallest* paths), hash set, hash map
* Dijkstra's is more expensive (Always use BFS for unweighted graphs)


# A\*
* Add a utility cost to the path cost (adjusted Dijkstra's)
* Heuristic is optimistic (overestimating true cost will lead us to )
    * Admissible
    * Consistent
* All the heuristic does is mess with the order of when we try a specific path
* Add the value of the heuristic to the weight of the path (= estimated cost, sort by this)
